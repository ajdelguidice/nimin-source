And since her winged arms will be occupied with flying, her legs wind up cradling your back as she begins to take off in the middle of the bazaar, positioning you much lower down her body. You get a mighty whiff of arousal as pre drools over your lips, your face mashed up against the tip of the large erection in her loin cloth... Nevertheless, she avoids humping you too much as she focuses on remaining balanced in flight, giving you a chance to twist around and watch the sand fly by below. The two of you go higher and higher, giving you a fantastic view of the desert. You fly out of Oviasis and can soon clearly see the path to your destination: a large dune about 2 hours away on foot. You wouldn't have given much attention such a dune in your usual exploration, since it looks like many many many of the others, but as you fly over to the opposite side you can make out a large jutting stone overhanging a cave.\r\rThe strange woman takes you down and lands you gently atop the sand, giving you a good view of the outside of 'her place'. A simple tunnel burrowing into the ground beneath the rock, the entrance is decorated with all sorts of crystalline chimes that softly ring out with a slight breeze. There's also some painted barriers to keep the sand out as well as a large barrel of water and towels to allow somebody to remove any sand from themselves as well. Otherwise, you can't quite tell what's in the tunnel.\r\r\"Well, umm... This is my home!\""
